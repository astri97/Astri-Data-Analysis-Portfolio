## About Me

Hi, I'm Astri! I have an analytical background in Psychology and I'm currently on track to completing my Masters degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation and passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights from large and complex datasets. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and various data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn which I've applied in various academic and personal project settings.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data science and analysis tools and techniques. 

**I am also passionate about:** 
- cooking 🥘🍚
- reading and learning 💻📜📚
- being outside in nature 🌱
- traveling 🗺️ 
- sustainability 

Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am committed to lifelong learning both in my professional field and in my everyday life.
