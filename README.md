## About Me

Hi, I'm Astri! I have an analytical background in Psychology and I'm currently on track to completing my Masters degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation and passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights from large and complex datasets. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and various data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn which I've applied in various academic and personal project settings.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. My love for learning extends beyond technical skills into various life skills as well.

I am passionate about cooking and continuously research new recipes to broaden my culinary skills. Reading and traveling are other avenues through which I expand my understanding of the world, immersing myself in different cultures and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. These experiences not only enrich my personal life but also enhance my professional abilities, providing a well-rounded approach to problem-solving and creativity.

Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am committed to lifelong learning and the pursuit of knowledge, both in my professional field and in my everyday life.
